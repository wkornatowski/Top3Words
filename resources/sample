CHAPTER L
My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name
Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing
longer or more explicit than Pip. So I called myself Pip, and
came to be called Pip.
I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority
of his tombstone and my sister�Mrs. Joe Gargery, who mar

and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days
were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies re
garding what they were like were unreasonably derived from
their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave
me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with
curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscrip

conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five
little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which
were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred
to the memory of five little brothers of mine�who gave up
trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal strug

they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their
trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state
of existence.

the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first distinct
impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been
gained on a memorable raw, damp afternoon toward evening,
